&lt;h1&gt;Main features&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Optimizations for intersections&lt;/h4&gt;
The main purpose of this release was to further optimize rendering performance by skipping object intersections with other sheets. From now by default an object&amp;#39;s sheets will only intersect its own sheets and never other static or dynamic sheets. This is
 the usual scenario since objects will never bump into other sheets when using collision detection.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Documentation&lt;/h4&gt;
Many of you have been asking for proper documentation, so here it goes. Check out the
&lt;a href="http://sheetengine.codeplex.com/documentation?"&gt;Documentation&lt;/a&gt; tab!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Examples&lt;/h4&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve also included examples for all of the documented features in a new downloadable zip file (&lt;a href="http://sheetengine.codeplex.com/downloads/get/571466"&gt;sheetengine-examples.zip&lt;/a&gt;), this could even be a better guide than the reference documentation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Fixes&lt;/h4&gt;
Some minor API changes and bug fixes are also included.&lt;/div&gt;
