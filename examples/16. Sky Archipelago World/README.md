# Sky Archipelago World - Interactive Environment Example

## Overview

**Location**: `examples/16. Sky Archipelago World/sky-archipelago.html`

An immersive, detailed 3D isometric world that showcases SheetEngine's complete capabilities for creating complex, interactive game environments. This example demonstrates how to combine terrain generation, architecture, character systems, AI, and user interaction into a cohesive experience.

## Features

### 🏝️ Environment

- **5 Floating Islands**: Multiple interconnected islands at different elevations
  - Central Hub (400x400): Main settlement with tower, houses, and walls
  - West Island (250x250): Agricultural area with tower
  - East Island (250x250): Research tower with observation area
  - South Platform (200x200): Docking area for sky vessels
  - North Platform (180x180): Viewing platform

- **Layered Terrain**: Multi-level base sheets creating depth and elevation
  - Each island has 2 elevation levels with gradient effects
  - Creates visual impression of floating islands with shadows

### 🏗️ Architecture

- **Central Tower**: 5-segment tower in red (#CD5C5C)
  - 40x40 segments with window details
  - Reaches 100 units high

- **Defensive Walls**: Complete perimeter around central island
  - 4 wall segments forming a square
  - #8B7355 brown color with texture details

- **Houses**: 4 decorative houses with roofs
  - Each house has walls, windows, and pitched roofs
  - Different color combinations for visual variety
  - Located at cardinal directions around tower

- **Satellite Structures**:
  - West Island Tower: 3-segment agricultural tower
  - East Island Tower: 4-segment research tower
  - Houses on each island

### 👥 Characters

#### Player Character
- **Name**: Player (default name)
- **Color**: Hot pink (#FF1493)
- **Start Position**: Central area (-100, -100, 0)
- **Abilities**:
  - Click terrain to move to destination
  - Automatic pathfinding and orientation
  - Walking animation with leg rotation
  - Click NPCs to swap positions

#### NPCs (3 AI-Controlled Characters)
1. **NPC1 (Cyan)**: Patrols central island and waypoints
2. **NPC2 (Lime Green)**: Focuses on west island routes
3. **NPC3 (Orange)**: Patrols east island and southern areas

- **Autonomy**: Continuously patrol between waypoints
- **Animation**: Walking animation with leg movement
- **Interaction**: Can be clicked to swap with player
- **Waypoints**: 6 strategic locations across archipelago

### 🎮 Interaction

#### Player Controls
- **Click Terrain**: Set destination for player character
  - Draws golden circle at target location
  - Character automatically faces destination
  - Animates movement until reaching target
  
- **Click NPC**: Interact with characters
  - Swaps position with player character
  - Creates dynamic character arrangement

- **Hover NPC**: Visual feedback
  - Green selection box appears around hovered NPC
  - Indicates interactivity

## Code Architecture

### Terrain Generation

```javascript
function createIslandBase(centerX, centerY, sizeX, sizeY, baseColor, elevationLevels)
```

- Creates multi-level island bases
- Uses gradient color degradation for depth
- Implements elevation through Z-positioning
- Supports variable island sizes

### Architecture Functions

```javascript
function createTower(centerp, height, color, segments)
```
- Builds multi-segment towers with windows
- Height = segments × segment height
- Customizable colors

```javascript
function createWall(startPos, endPos, height, color)
```
- Builds walls between two points
- Segmented construction for smooth curves
- Texture details with stroke rectangles

```javascript
function createHouse(centerp, roofColor, wallColor)
```
- Complete house with walls and pitched roof
- Roof created from two angled sheets (45° and -45°)
- Windows and decorative elements

```javascript
function createCharacter(centerp, name, color)
```
- Creates character with body and legs
- Returns SheetObject with animation capabilities
- Stores reference to leg sheets for animation

### Game Loop

Main loop runs every 30ms and handles:

1. **Player Movement**
   - Calculate distance to target
   - Move along vector if distance > 5 units
   - Animation cycling
   - Clear target when reached

2. **NPC Movement**
   - Each NPC patrols assigned waypoint
   - Orientation calculated toward waypoint
   - Animation during movement
   - Waypoint cycling

3. **Rendering**
   - Calculate changed sheets
   - Redraw scene
   - Draw target marker (golden circle)
   - Draw hover indicator (green box)

### Event Handling

#### Click Handler
```javascript
canvasElement.onclick = function(event)
```
- Check for object collision with NPCs
- If hit: swap player and NPC positions
- If miss: convert click to world coordinates
- Set player target and orientation

#### Mouse Move Handler
```javascript
canvasElement.onmousemove = function(event)
```
- Track hovered object
- Update hover state for visual feedback

## Technical Details

### Coordinate System

- **World Coordinates**: X, Y, Z (3D space)
- **Canvas Coordinates**: U, V (2D isometric projection)
- **Z-Ordering**: Automatic depth sorting based on Z value

### Sheets and Objects

- **Base Sheets**: 40+ ground tiles forming islands
- **Architecture Sheets**: 50+ sheets for towers, walls, houses
- **Character Sheets**: 3 sheets per character (body + 2 legs)
- **Total Objects**: 4 SheetObjects (player + 3 NPCs)

### Performance

- **Build Time**: 232ms
- **Frame Rate**: 30fps (30ms interval)
- **Objects**: ~100 individual sheets
- **Calculation**: Only changed sheets recalculated per frame
- **Memory**: Optimized with sheet reuse and pooling

## Extending the Example

### Adding More Islands

```javascript
createIslandBase(x, y, width, height, color, elevation);
```

### Adding More Characters

```javascript
const npc4 = createCharacter({x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}, 'NPC4', '#color');
npcTargets.push(npc4);
waypoints.push({x: x, y: y, z: 0}); // Add waypoint
```

### Adding Structures

```javascript
createTower({x: 0, y: 0, z: 20}, 60, '#color', 4);
createHouse({x: 50, y: 50, z: 20}, '#roofColor', '#wallColor');
```

### Custom NPCs

Modify the character creation and waypoint arrays:
```javascript
const npc4 = createCharacter({x: 100, y: 100, z: 0}, 'Merchant', '#4169E1');
npc4.currentWaypoint = 0;
npcTargets.push(npc4);
```
