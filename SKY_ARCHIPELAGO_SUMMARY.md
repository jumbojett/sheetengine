   - Defensive perimeter walls
   - 4 houses (pink, blue, green, yellow)
   - Main settlement area

2. **West Island** (Light Green #8FBC8F, 250x250)
   - Agricultural tower (3 segments)
   - Farming/resource area
   - House structure

3. **East Island** (Blue #1E90FF, 250x250)
   - Research tower (4 segments)
   - Observation/science focus
   - House structure

4. **South Platform** (Gold #DAA520, 200x200)

- Disappears when target reached
- Provides clear goal indication

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Functions

#### Terrain Generation
```javascript
createIslandBase(x, y, width, height, color, elevation)
// Multi-level islands with gradient effects
```

#### Architecture
```javascript
createTower(pos, height, color, segments)
createWall(start, end, height, color)
createHouse(pos, roofColor, wallColor)
// Modular structure building
```

#### Characters
```javascript
createCharacter(pos, name, color)
// Reusable character factory with animation
```

### Game Loop (30ms interval)

1. **Player Movement**
   - Calculate distance to target
   - Move along vector
   - Animate legs
   - Update orientation

2. **NPC Movement**
   - Navigate waypoints
   - Patrol autonomously
   - Animate movement
   - Cycle waypoints

3. **Rendering**
   - Calculate changed sheets
   - Redraw canvas
   - Draw overlays (markers, highlights)

### Event System
- **Click Handler**: Object detection + coordinate transformation
- **Mouse Move Handler**: Hover state tracking
- **Coordinate Conversion**: World ↔ Canvas ↔ UI

## 📊 Technical Metrics

### Performance
- **Build Time**: 208ms
- **Sheets**: 100+ individual 2D planes
- **Objects**: 4 SheetObjects
- **Frame Rate**: 30fps (33ms per frame)
